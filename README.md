# BoxitMain
It is a simple Diary app, where you can record memorable moment. It is built with angular 4 and Node(Express)Js, with mysql(using `sequelize` as ORM).
This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.1.1. 

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
 
I also added a build in the public/view folder.In the `public` folder, run `node server.js`, then Navigate to `http://localhost:5000/` to use the built version.
Dont forget to run `npm install` to load dependencies.

Please contact me if the app has any issues.
